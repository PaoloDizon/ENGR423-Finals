# ENGR423-Finals

Unfortunately because of COVID-19, we were not able to meet up for this class for most of the semester. 
We were planning to work on the full sized drones in the outdoors after the midterm, ones that Professor Pramod uses for his research.
To compensate for not meeting in class, he gave us an alternative assignment and an alternative means of working with the drones.
For this assignment we used JMAV and Qground control to simulate a drone and the outside world. This assignment was worked on with a partner.
The specifications for the assignment were:

1. Write a Python program to do the following:

        -Plans the motion plan of a quadrotor in JMAVSim/Qgroundcontrol/Webots using customized GPS locations.
        -Implement Geofencing. 
        -Gives the user an option to pick the pattern out of a set of them.
        -Logs and plots the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS measurements during the missions.
        -Visualize the GPS coordinates using Google Maps API.

 2. Additionally, students should build a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the operation of this mission using TKinter and Python.
 
 
 NOTE: I could not figure out the fourth part of Q1 before the deadline :(
